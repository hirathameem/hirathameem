### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Nathira Salim!

I am currently an aspiring DevOps engineer working as an apprentice in Onloop - a bubbling global startup based in Singapore.
I have had almost 5 years of experience in QA (manual testing) and have decided to change branch (the irony!) and work on cloud tech and devops.

Currently working on CI/CD for current org.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a CI/CD pipeline.

Experience so far:
1. Flutter
2. Git and  Github
3. Gitlab
4. Fastlane
5. Terraform

Certifications gained in 2022 alone:
1. Google Cloud Digital Leader
2. Microsoft Azure AZ900
3. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
1. I am sometimes fun to be with
2. I work very hard to solve issues
3. I take my work very seriously..sometimes a tad too much.
